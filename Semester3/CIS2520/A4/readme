Description:

This program takes a data space delimited data file and inserts
each element into an AVL tree. The program has the ability to
add/count distinct keys and remove. The tree is self balancing
thanks to a rotation algorithm.


Compilation:

This program can be compiled without error from the A4 folder using:

    "gcc -std=c99 -Wall src/avltree.c -I../include -o ./A4"

The program can also be compiled by typing "make".



Usage:

The program can be run by executing the following (from the
A4 folder):

    "./A4"

Or by running the Makefile command
"make run" from the A4 folder.

    "make"



Limitations:

It is assumed that the data file will have less than
500 characters on a single line.



Testing:

Testing is done using unit test assertions. By passing
each assertion test we verify that the programs vital
functions can be report and respond correctly. See
Testing.h for more on assertions.
