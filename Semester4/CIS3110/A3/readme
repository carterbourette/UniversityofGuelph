# Description:

This assignment is comprised of two programs:

    (1) Dining Philosophers:

        An implementation of the dining philosopher problem using a C mutex.
        Each process checks a shared variable or a pile of forks to see if
        there are enough resources to continue. Since each philosopher req-
        uires two forks to eat we check that the pile contains more than
        one fork before the philosopher tries to eat. If the philosopher
        cannot eat due to a lack of resources he can think while waiting for
        a fork. The dining philosopher algorithm in my implementation uses a
        mutex to lock the resource in use during manipulation.

    (2) Memory Mapper:

        Create a simulator to utilize four memory mapping functions (First-Fit,
        Best-Fit, Worst-Fit, and Next-Fit) to map memory for given processes
        (see Assumptions) in virtual memory 128MB of space.

        First-Fit:
            Inserts into the first available location. Strips oldest
            memory process if no room available.

        Best-Fit:

            Inserts process into the smallest suitable hole. Strips oldest
            memory process if no room available.

        Worst-Fit:

            Inserts process into the largest available hole. Strips oldest
            memory process if no room available.

        Next-Fit:

            Identical to first-fit except inserts process starting at the end
            index of the last insertion. Strips oldest memory process if no
            room available.

## Assumptions:

    Input file for Part 2 will be in the format of:

        [ unique_id ] [ memory_load_size_MB ]



# Compilation:

This program can be compiled without error from the A3 folder using:

        "make"


# Usage:

The programs can be run by executing the following (from the
A3 folder):

    ./dine [ num_philosophers ] [ num_times_to_eat ]

    ./holes [ input_file ]
